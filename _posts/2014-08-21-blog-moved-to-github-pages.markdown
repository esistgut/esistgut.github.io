I just migrated my old blog from [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com) to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). It is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the theme is based on [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com) blog templates, [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome) and [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts).

The [old domain](http://giacomo.graziosi.info) is still active but for now it will work only as a redirect to this one.

It is my first time using a static content generator but the Jekyll platform seems nice, I look forward on adding some more features like a tag cloud or an automatic résumé generator.
