I just made public under the terms of the GPLv3 a couple of old university projects hoping they will help someone. Here they are: <a href="http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/ufs" target="_blank">ufs</a> (micro file system, a fat-alike user space file system with some unix extensions) and <a href="http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/vespasiano" target="_blank">Vespasiano</a> (small movie theater manager, done when learning sockets in Java).

Please note that they both are <strong>so bugged to be broken</strong>. Be careful :-).
